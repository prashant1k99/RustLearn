use core::panic;

fn main() {
    // Unwind the stack or Abort in response
    // By default, when a panic occurs the program starts unwinding, which means Rust walks back up the stack
    // and cleans up the data from each function it encounters.
    // However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot of work. Rust, therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of immediately aborting,
    // which ends the program without cleaning up.
    // Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system.
    // If in your project you need to make the resultant binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to
    // aborting upon a panic by adding panic = 'abort' to the appropriate [profile] sections in your Cargo.toml file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release mode, add this:
    // [profile.release]
    // panic = 'abort'

    panic!("This is my panic!");
    // thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:15:5:
    // This is my panic!

    // This is a non-recoverable error
}
