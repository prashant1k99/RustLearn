# Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures:

Rust's design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and techniques and one significant influence is *functional programming*. Programming in a functional style often inclues using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth.

In this chapter we'll cover:

- *Closure*, a functin-like construct you can store in a varibale
- *Iterators*, a way of processing a series of elements
- How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project in minigrep
- The performance of closures adn iterators (Spoiler alert: They're faster than you might think!)
